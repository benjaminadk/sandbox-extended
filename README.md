# sandbox-extended
this site expands on my original css sandbox which was a vanilla js project
## current status
this project is not complete
i am looking for some feedback at this point as to what the final version might look like
## ideas
i know i need something impressive for the landing page right now it is bare bones
the sandbox itself is almost done
i want to add the following
- finish the unit labels
- add in sliders so a gradient background can be added to the box
