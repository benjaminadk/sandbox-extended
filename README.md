# sandbox-extended
this site expands on my original css sandbox which was a vanilla js project<br>[Orignal Version](https://benjaminadk.github.io/css-sandbox/index.html)<br>
[NEW VERSION OF CSS Sandbox](https://benjaminadk.github.io/sandbox-extended/index.html)
## current status
this project is not complete
i am looking for some feedback at this point as to what the final version might look like
## ideas
i know i need something impressive for the landing page right now it is bare bones<br>
***the sandbox itself is almost done***<br>
# i want to add the following
- finish the unit labels
- add in sliders so a gradient background can be added to the box
- add the videos on the landing page and in other spots where explainations would be needed 
    - there are youtube icon buttons that will popup dialogs containing iframes
    - i think i have one working on the landing page
# what i am looking for
- ideas for the landing page...animation or something
- feedback on what you think of the site so far
